# Install on Windows

## Compiling The Server

The only windows compiler supported for now is MSVC 15 (Visual Studio Community 2017).

When downloading dependencies (such as OpenSSL, Boost) you must get the
version corresponding to the compiler version (x86 or x64) you will use, else
the linking will fail.

1. Get Git, and clone the repository
   (https://github.com/wowtbconline/TrinityTBC.git).

2. Install [CMake][cmake]

3. Install [OpenSSL 1.1.x][openssl] note the directory to which you
   install it. Caution, do not use the 'Light' version. OpenSSL 1.1 is also supported.

4. Install [Boost 1.67][boost] or higher.
   Get the windows prebuilt binaries corresponding to your MSVC compiler. 
   Set the **environment** variable (not a CMake variable) `BOOST_ROOT` to wherever you
   installed Boost for CMake to find Boost location. 

5. Run `cmake-gui` and indicate the repository as the source directory, and a
   directory of your choice to hold the compiled artifacts.

5. Install MySQL, as instructed in the "Setting Up The DB" section below.

6. Click Configure, then tweak the variables that appear.

   In particular, you should make sure that the `SSL_EAY_*` and `LIB_EAY_*` variables point to the
   right version of OpenSSL (usually the one you installed at step 3).
   If CMake has trouble finding OpenSSL, you can also define the OPENSSL_ROOT_DIR entry in cmake then configure again.

   Set `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` to the location where you want the server to be
   installed. This is where the "INSTALL" project generated by CMake will
   install the binaries.
   Note that this location is important if you want to use dynamic (reloadable) script libraries.

   If you installed MySQL in an unusual way (e.g. by unzipping binaries or
   compiling manually), indicate the location of the MySQL dynamic libraries in
   a new variable named `MYSQL_ADD_LIBRARIES_PATH`; and the location of the
   MySQL headers in a new variabled named `MYSQL_ADD_INCLUDE_PATH`.

7. Click Generate, and select your compiler.

8. Open the `TrinityTBC.sln` solution generated in the build directory.

9. Right-click the `INSTALL` project, then click `build`.

## Extracting maps, vmaps and dbc

Follow these steps after compiling the core.

- Copy `libmysql.dll` from your mysql directory (for example `C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 5.7\lib`) to your
  burning crusade install directory. (This dependency should be removed)

- Copy `src/tools/map_extractor/<configuration>/mapextractor.exe`from the build
  directory to your burning crusade install directory.

- Copy `src/tools/mmaps_generator/<configuration>/mmaps_generator.exe` from the build
  directory to your burning crusade install directory.

- Copy `src/tools/vmap4_extractor/<configuration>/vmap4extractor.exe` from the build
  directory to your burning crusade install directory.

- Copy `src/tools/vmap4_assembler/<configuration>/vmap4assembler.exe` from the build
  directory to your burning crusade install directory.

- Run `mapextractor.exe` in the game directory. This will create two directories
  named `maps` and `dbc`.

- Run `vmap4extractor.exe` in the game directory. This will create a directory
  named `Buildings`.

- Create a directory named `vmaps`, then run `vmap4assembler.exe Buildings
  vmaps` in the game directory.

- Create a directory named `mmaps`, then run `mmaps_generator.exe` in the game
  directory.

- Move the directories `maps`, `dbc`, `vmaps` and `mmaps` from your game
  directory to your server install location. This was the value of the
  `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` variable inside CMake. If you're not sure, you can
  re-run `cmake-gui` to check. You can delete the `Buildings` directory.

## Setting Up The DB

1. Download the last world database [here][world_db], extract it to your CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX directory. 

3. You may follow the instructions [here][trinity_db_instructions]. Just use the world you just downloaded instead.

<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
## Install and Configure the Server

- Copy to your CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX directory :

	- `libeay32.dll` from the OpenSSL install directory.
	- `libmysql.dll` from your mariadb directory (for example `C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 5.7\lib`)

<!-- comment for spacing -->

- Rename `authserver.conf.dist` from your server install directory to
  `authserver.conf`.

- Rename `worldserver.conf.dist` from your server install directory to
  `worldserver.conf`.

- Update `authserver.conf` options:  
	- **LoginDatabaseInfo**: See info in conf file

- Update `worldserver.conf` options:  
	- **LoginDatabaseInfo**: See info in conf file
	- **WorldDatabaseInfo**: See info in conf file
	- **CharacterDatabaseInfo**: See info in conf file
	- **LogsDatabaseInfo**: See info in conf file
	- **MySQLExecutable**: See info in conf file
	- **DataDir**: Set this your data folder you just filled last step.
	- **LogsDir***: Because you'll probably want logs. See info in conf file.
	
Local realmlist entries are already configured in database for BC and LK, so you don't need
to add one yourself for development. If you need to, just look at the structure
of the `realmlist` table in the `auth` database.

Some dummy accounts are already in the database, from `test1` to `test5`. The
password are the usernames.

## Running the Server

### Running From Visual Studio

I highly suggest:
- Changing the "Working Directory" option for the `worldserver` project in Visual Studio to your binaries folder. (= your CMAKE_INSTALL folder)
- Setting up the worldserver as the StartUp Project

From there you can use the INSTALL project to compile and just start the debugger with the big "Local Windows Debugger" button with without hassle.

### Running From Windows

Just start the executables in the CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX folder you specified before.
